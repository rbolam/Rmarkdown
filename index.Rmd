```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

In the r setup code chunk, you can set global options that will then work for **all** code chunks - for example, you might not want to print messages.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r 1, eval = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r 2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~continent, nrow = 1)
```

## Code only

If you want to show the code only, set `eval = FALSE` in the curly brackets (check the RMD file to see it):

```{r 3, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~continent, nrow = 1)
```

## Outputs only

If you want to show the outputs such as figures only, set `echo = FALSE` in the curly brackets (check the RMD file to see it):

```{r 4, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~continent, nrow = 1)
```
